# TowerDefense2
My second attempt at a tower defense game.

Instead of using TypeScript, I decided to try es6 using Babel: [https://babeljs.io/].   
For now I'm using PHP to serve the application  

Babel transpiles es6+ javascripts/*js to es5 in lib/.  
Babel is run with "npm run build", and is configured as described in .presets and package.json.
