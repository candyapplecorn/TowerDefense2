Instead of using TypeScript, I decided to try es6 using Babel: [https://babeljs.io/].   
~~For now I'm using PHP to serve the application~~
*Thanks, GitHub Pages!*

Babel transpiles es6+ javascripts/*js to es5 in lib/.  
Babel is run with "npm run build", and is configured as described in .presets and package.json.
