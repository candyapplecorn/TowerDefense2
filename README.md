# TowerDefense2
My second attempt at a tower defense game.

Instead of using TypeScript, I decided to try es6 using Babel.
For now I'm using PHP to serve the application, out of convenience.

Babel transpiles javascripts/*js to es5 in lib/.
Babel is run with "npm run build", and is configured as described in .presets and package.json.
